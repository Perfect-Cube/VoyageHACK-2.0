### **Transforming Hotel Search at TBO.com**

- **Voice-Powered Search with Large Language Models (LLMs):**  
  Effortlessly find the perfect stay using natural language commands, e.g., “Find a beachfront villa in Maldives under $500/night.”  
  
- **Conversational Search via Neural Networks:**  
  Engage with virtual assistants in real-time for dynamic queries like “Show me hotels with rooftop pools.”   

- **Image-Based Search with AI:**  
  Upload images of dream accommodations and let neural networks match your preferences to visually similar options.

### **Core Technologies and Algorithms:**

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** (using BM25, Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)) Combines live data retrieval and AI-driven processing for up-to-date results using algorithms like BM25 and Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR).
- **Neural Networks:** (e.g., Transformer-based BERT for text, ResNet for image analysis) Enable personalized recommendations and user interaction through models such as Transformer-based BERT and ResNet for image analysis.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** (e.g., GPT-4, T5 for conversational AI) Deliver intelligent, natural language-based search and conversational guidance using models like GPT-4 and T5.
